This new-old project aims to get a fast CRUD. Only the database variables are needed, without any table name defined.
The second step of the project is to guess the records fields input type automatically. The fields maybe predefined in an array.
The CRUD makes it very easy ans fast to create a page for managing a single table data, with the less writing code to get an output for end user.
This new-old project was just a 2 days coding pleasure, so improvement of code, sql security requests and structure is basic. Feel free to provide your version and add/modify the code.
